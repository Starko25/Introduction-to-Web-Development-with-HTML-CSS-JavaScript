          <p>
            With 2 years of experience as a full stack developer, 
            I have worked extensively on both application and presentation layers. 
            My expertise in deploying applications and microservices on IBM Cloud has given me 
            a comprehensive understanding of cloud architecture, while my proficiency in IBM Watson Services, 
            including Watson Assistant, NLU, and Sentiment Analyzer, has allowed me to create innovative and high-quality applications.
